# Predicting employee salary levels
The idea is to build a Bayesian Ordinal Regression for Salary Prediction: salary column is categorical (low, medium, high), model it as an Ordinal Probit.

The Goal: Determine which factors (e.g., last_evaluation, number_project, average_montly_hours, tenure) most strongly influence an employee’s probability of moving from a “medium” to a “high” salary tier.
